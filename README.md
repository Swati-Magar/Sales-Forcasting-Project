# Sales-Forcasting-Project

âœ¨ Sales Forecasting Project â€“ End-to-End Workflow âœ¨

Over the past few days, I worked on applying time-series analysis and machine learning techniques to the Store Sales â€“ Time Series Forecasting dataset (Kaggle). Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of my learning journey:

ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Exploratory Sales Analysis (EDA)

Cleaned and explored sales data with Pandas.

Generated descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode).

Visualized sales trends, seasonality, and weekday effects.

ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Simple Forecast with Moving Average

Implemented rolling averages (7-day & 30-day).

Compared forecasts vs. actual sales.

Visualized smoothing trends with line plots.

ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Feature Engineering for Sales Data

Extracted year, month, weekday from date.

Created holiday & weekend flags.

Built lag features & rolling averages to capture temporal patterns.

ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Multiple Regression Model

Trained a regression model using promotions, holidays, and lag features.

Evaluated model using RMSE & MAE.

Analyzed feature coefficients for insights.

ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Regularized Regression (Ridge & Lasso)

Applied Ridge/Lasso regression to avoid overfitting.

Compared with linear regression baseline.

Used Lasso for feature selection (zeroing out weak predictors).

ðŸ”¹ Task 6: Regression with External Data

Enhanced models by merging oil prices & holiday events.

Observed accuracy improvements in forecasting.

Learned how external factors boost predictive power.

âœ… Key Learnings:

Importance of feature engineering in time-series.

How regularization techniques improve generalization.

Value of incorporating external datasets in forecasting.

Practical use of Python, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
